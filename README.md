# TAURIS: Tactile Audio Responsive Intelligent System

## Overview

TAURIS (Tactile Audio Responsive Intelligent System) is an innovative assistive technology designed to enhance the accessibility of tactile graphics for visually impaired individuals. The system provides real-time audio descriptions that correspond to the tactile graphics being explored, facilitating independent learning and improving information retention.

TAURIS consists of three main components:

- **Pre-labelled tactile graphics**: Graphics enriched with structured annotations.
- **Interactive web tool**: A web-based platform for labelling and managing tactile graphics.
- **Mobile application**: An Android-based application employing deep learning-based fingertip detection to provide contextual audio feedback.

## Features

✔️ **Real-time fingertip detection** – Uses deep learning-based computer vision to track fingertips.  
✔️ **Multi-modal accessibility** – Reduces dependence on Braille and screen readers with instant audio feedback.  
✔️ **Robust performance** – Works under varying lighting conditions and detects both hands.  
✔️ **User-friendly web tool** – Allows educators to annotate tactile graphics efficiently.  

## Why TAURIS?

Traditional methods of accessing tactile graphics—such as Braille labels or screen readers—can be slow and cumbersome. TAURIS streamlines this process by offering **immediate, context-sensitive audio feedback**, significantly improving learning efficiency and user experience.

## Installation & Usage

### 📱 Mobile App

1. Download the TAURIS app (**link coming soon**).
2. Open the app and scan a pre-labelled tactile graphic using your device’s camera.
3. Explore the tactile graphic by touch and receive real-time audio feedback.

### 🌐 Web Tool

1. Visit [TAURIS Web Tool](#) (**link coming soon**).
2. Upload tactile graphics and add structured annotations.
3. Save and export labelled graphics for use with the mobile app.

## 🎓 Evaluation & Research

TAURIS has been rigorously evaluated using a **mixed-methods approach**, including structured interviews, controlled experiments, and user feedback. Key findings indicate that TAURIS:

- 🚀 **Improves information retrieval speed** compared to Braille text.
- 🎯 **Enhances comprehension accuracy** in comparison to screen readers.
- 👍 **Increases user preference and engagement** due to its intuitive design.
